## Once and future developer
I have programming credits on 5 video game titles[^games], and I will be graduating from General Assemblyâ€™s Software Engineering Immersive boot camp in November 2022. I have always been interested in technology fields, and I am looking forward to bringing my problem solving skills and creativity back into the software industry.

[^games]:Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Rogue Spear (Dreamcast).
    Soldier of Fortune: Gold Edition (PS2).
    Star Trek Voyager: Elite Force (PS2).
