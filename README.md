## Once and future developer...
Once and future developerâ€¦
	In the past I was a video game programmer at Majesco where I have credits on 5 published titles[^games]. During the Y2K scandal, I lost my job, and continued my career down a variety of paths leading up to automotive mechanic. I found that as a mechanic I used many of the same skills that I used as a developer, identifying a problem, forming a plan to address it, testing, etc. I also learned more about serving customers, understanding their needs and priorities, and how to explain issues clearly and succinctly. I always wanted to get back into coding though, so I enrolled in General Assemblyâ€™s Software Engineering bootcamp to update my skills, and now I am excited to be coming back to the field.
