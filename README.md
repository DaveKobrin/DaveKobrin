### Once and future developer
	I have programming credits on 5 video game titles, and I will be graduating from General Assembly’s Software Engineering Immersive boot camp in November 2022. I have always been interested in technology fields, and I am looking forward to bringing my problem solving skills and creativity back into the software industry.
